Why load the entire application at startup? Unless you are building a trivially simple app, the user is unlikely to visit every part of your site.
With DecoJS you build your application as complex as you want, and load each page lazily when needed. Instead of loading everything as a single page, you load it as multiple pages. In a DecoJS app, every page is completely independent from the others, making maintenance of a continuously growing website easy.
