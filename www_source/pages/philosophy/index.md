  <p>How DecoJS is different
</div>
    
DecoJS is written for large websites with multiple pages written by several people over the span of many years. In such a setting nobody
knows how large or complex the website will be or what new features will be added next year. This kind of website cannot be built as a single 
page, where everything is loaded prior to the app starting. It cannot be bundled together into a single JS file which every user has to 
download before the page is ready to function. It can only be built with lazy loading and modularity at its core.

DecoJS encourages you to build large modular websites which parts can be lazily loaded when needed. These parts work independently of each
other making maintenance and debugging easy, even for people who has never seen the source code before. The way modules are used makes it 
possible for multiple developers to work on different features on the same page, without worrying about conflicts. 

DecoJS is built on four basic principles: scalable, maintainable, debuggable and lazy. By building your website with DecoJS and these principles
you can be assured that it too will scale to any size and complexity. Both developers and designers will find it easy to maintain the website,
even people brought into the project at a later date. The page can be debugged using modern developer tools, without having to hunt through 
several files trying to understand several hundred lines of JavaScript. The website will be split into several pages which are lazily loaded
only when needed, reducing the amount of JavaScript loaded at startup.
