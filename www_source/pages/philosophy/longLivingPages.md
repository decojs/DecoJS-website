Single page applications are only useful in a few specific scenarios. DecoJS recognizes this, and supports Long Living Pages. An LLP is
part of a large website with multiple pages which the user navigates between. What sets the LLP apart from static pages is the JavaScript
which makes it interactive. A user will land on this page, interact with it for a few minutes, and then navigate to the next page.

Long living pages are easy to build with DecoJS since the HTML decides what JavaScript to load. Other frameworks would have you create a 
new app for each page, making the construction of an entire website with multiple pages a monumental task. By having the HTML control itself,
every page can be turned into a separate LLP. This improves the user experience without making maintenance and growth impossible
