When a command or query is executed it will be in a busy state until the server responds. This menas that if you try to execute it again nothing will happen; it will fail silently. If you hook the command or query up to a button, then pressing the button multiple times will not cause it to execute multiple times. 

Both commands and queries expose an observable called `isBusy` that will tell you if it is currently executing. Since it is an observable you can hook it up to a button in the view, for example

```js
define(['deco/qvc'], function(qvc){
  return function MyVM(){
    
    
    this.param1 = ko.observable();
    this.submit = qvc.createCommand('Submit', {
      param1: this.param1
    });
    
  };
});
```
```html
<form data-viewmodel="MyVm" data-bind="submit: submit">

  <input data-bind="textInput: param1">
  
  <input type="submit" data-bind="disable: submit.isBusy">

</form>
```
