<meta name="title" content="Loading indicator - DecoJS">


<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Loading indicator</h1>
</div>

To build a SPA with DecoJS you need an element with the attribute `data-outlet`. The contents of this element will be updated by DecoJS as the user navigates your application. We have seen earlier how the contents will be lazy loaded by DecoJS when it is needed, which reduces the startup time of your application. This however means that it can sometimes take a while before the page loads. To indicate to the user that content is loading it is normal to have a spinner. While DecoJS won't put a spinner on the page for you, it will tell you when the contents of the `data-outlet` is loading, so you can show your own spinner. This gives you full control of how the spinner should look, and you can show and hide it through pure CSS.

The element with the `data-outlet` attribute will be given a `data-loading` attribute by DecoJS, and the value of this attribute will be `true` when contents is loading and `false` when the contents has loaded. Using the attribute selector in CSS you can now cover up the page with your very own spinner, for example like this:

```css
[data-outlet]{
  position: relative;
}
[data-outlet][data-loading=true]::after{
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5) url('spinner.gif') no-repeat center center;
  z-index: 10;
  content: '';
}
```
