  <h1>When contexts</h1>
</div>

The when function that is injected into the ViewModel can be used to subscribe to events safely, so when the viewmodel is destroyed the events are unsubscribed from. To ensure this, the viewmodel is given a context that the events exist in. Each viewmodel is given its own context, and when a viewmodel is destroyed, so is the context that it was given. 

A context has the ability to create child contexts, and these child contexts can themselves create child contexts, resulting in a hierarchy of contexts such that destroying a context will also destroy all the children of the context. Here is a simple example

```js
define('ExampleVM', ['somethingEvent'], function(something){
  
  return function ExampleVM(model, when){
  
    //calling when with no parameters creates a child context
    var subWhen = when();
    
    //subscribe to something using the child context
    subWhen(something, function(){
      console.log("something has happened");
    });
    
    //get notified when the child context is destroyed
    subWhen.thisIsDestroyed(function(){
      console.log("subWhen has been destroyed");
    });
    
    //get notified when something is unsubscribed from
    when(something.isUnsubscribedFrom, function(){
      console.log("something is no longer subscribed to");
    });
    
    //destroy all the child contexts of when, including subWhen
    when.destroyChildContexts();
  }
});
```

It is a good idea to create child contexts when you need to pass the when function on to another viewmodel. This way you have just as much control over the subscriptions as you have over the viewmodel, so you can destroy the context when you no longer need the viewmodel.
