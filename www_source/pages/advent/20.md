  <h1>QVC Hooks</h1>

The above image shows the process used by QVC when a command or query is executed. All of the boxes with thick outlines are points that we can hook into with our own functions. The available hooks, and what they do, are:

* **beforeExecute**: called before a request is made to the server. Use this to update any of the parameters before they are validated.
* **canExecute**: called after validation as a final check. Return false from this hook to prevent the command or query from executing.
* **success**: called if the command or query successfully executes on the server.
* **error**: called if an error occured on the server side.
* **invalid**: called if the serverside or clientside validation of the parameters failed.
* **result**: called with the result of a query as its only parameter.
* **complete**: called after a request has been made to the server, no matter what the server returned.

To hook into any of these you need to call the method with a callback function as the only parameter. The hooks can be chained, so the result will look something like this:

```js
define(['deco/qvc'], function(qvc){

  return function MyVM(){

    this.submit = qvc.createQuery('GetSomething', {
      param: 'something'
    }).beforeExecute(function(){
      //called before a request is made to the server. 
      //Use this to update any of the parameters before they are validated.
    }).canExecute(function(){
      //called after validation as a final check. 
      //Return false from this hook to prevent the command or query from executing.
      return true;
    }).success(function(){
      //called if the command or query successfully executes on the server.
    }).error(function(){
      //called if an error occured on the server side.
    }).invalid(function(){
      //called if the serverside or clientside validation of the parameters failed.
    }).result(function(queryResult){
      //called with the result of a query as its only parameter.
    }).complete(function(){
      //called after a request has been made to the server, no matter what the server returned.
    });
  };
});
```
