DecoJS supports multiple viewmodels on the same page, even having the same viewmodel several times, by using the `data-viewmodel` attribute. DecoJS will use RequireJS to load the AMD module with the same name as the data-viewmodel attribute.

```html
<nav data-viewmodel="MainMenuVM">
  <!-- ...menu items... -->
</nav>
<section data-viewmodel="FeedbackVM">
  <form data-bind="submit: sendFeedback">
    <label>Please enter your feedback here:</label>
    <textarea data-bind="value: feedback"></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Send feedback</button>
  </form>
</section>
<aside data-viewmodel="LoginVM">
  <form data-bind="submit: login">
    <label>Username<input data-bind="value: username" type="email"></label>
    <label>Password<input data-bind="value: password" type="password"></label>
    <input type="submit">Login</input>
  </form>
</aside>
```

This is possible because the modules return constructors so multiple instances can be made, and each instance is given control only of the element it is bound to. On large and complex websites you often have several sections of the visible page that operate independently, for example a main menu at the top left and a login form on the top right along with some main content in the center of the page. DecoJS lets you use a different viewmodel for each of these sections, so the main menu can be implemented independently and with no knowledge of the login form or any of the other content of the page. This independence means different developers or even different teams can implement each of these features in paralell without having to worry about affecting each other.
