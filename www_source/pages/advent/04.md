  <h1>Pubsub between viewmodels</h1>
</div>

On [December 1st](#01) we saw how `data-viewmodel` lets us have multiple viewmodles on the same page, and [yesterday](#03) we saw how to use pubsub to proclaim that an event had occured and then react to that event. Today we will combine these two, so that one viewmodel can react to an event proclaimed by another viewmodel. 

For two viewmodels to communicate using events they both need to have the event as a dependency, so lets start by first creating an AMD module with events:

```js
define('aProductEvents', ['deco/proclaimWhen'], function(proclaimWhen){

  return proclaimWhen.extend({
    hasBeenAddedToTheShoppingCart: function(productId, productName, price){},
    hasBeenRemovedFromTheShoppingCart: function(productId, productName, price){},
    //add more events here...
  });

});
```

This module can now be depended on by a `buyButton` viewmodel. When a customer clicks the buy button, we notify the other viewmodels on the page that the product has been added to the cart:

```js
require('BuyButtonVM', ['aProductEvents'], function(aProduct){
  
  return function BuyButtonVM(model){
    var self = this;
  
    this.productId = ko.observable(model.id);
    this.productName = ko.observable(model.name);
    this.price = ko.observable(model.price);
  
    this.buyButtonClickHandler = function(){
      //send a message to the server using ajax, and then:
      aProduct.hasBeenAddedToTheShoppingCart(self.productId(), self.productName(), self.price());
    }
  }
});
```

This simple viewmodel will send an ajax request to the server when the customer clicks the buy button, and then it will proclaim to any other viewmodel that are listening that a product has been added to the shopping cart. One of the viewmodels that might be listening is one that shows the total cost of the current viewmodel. It should subscribe to the event and react to it. We saw yesterday how easy it is to subscribe to events, but we also have to remember to unsubscribe when we are no longer interested in the event. It is easy to forget, and when you forget you can end up with memory leaks or strange bugs.

Luckily DecoJS has a way to subscribe to events so that they are automatically unsubscribed when the viewmodel is garbage collected. The viewmodel constructor is given a function called `when` as its second argument, and we can use this function to subscribe to events:

```js
require('TotalPriceVM', ['aProductEvents'], function(aProduct){
  
  return function TotalPriceVM(model, when){
    var self = this;
  
    this.totalPrice = ko.observable(0);
  
    function addItToTheTotalPrice(id, name, price){
      self.totalPrice(self.totalPrice() + price);
    }
    
    function removeItFromTheTotalPrice(id, name, price){
      self.totalPrice(self.totalPrice() - price);
    }
    
    init: {
      when(aProduct.hasBeenAddedToTheShoppingCart, addItToTheTotalPrice);
      when(aProduct.hasBeenRemovedFromTheShoppingCart, removeItFromTheTotalPrice);
    }
  }
});
```
