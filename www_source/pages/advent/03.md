  <h1>Pubsub with ProclaimWhen</h1>
</div>

DecoJS has a simple way to publish and subscribe to events, using the `deco/proclaimWhen` module. The name of the module indicates how you should think of the events, as in you should proclaim (publish) that something has happened, and then someone else can react to the event when it occures (subscribe). 

Three things are needed for an event to be used: the event, the publisher and the subscriber. A simple example looks like this:

```js
require(['deco/proclaimWhen'], function(proclaimWhen){

  //the subscriber and the publisher is the same object
  var when = proclaim = proclaimWhen.extend({
    somethingHasHappened: function(){},
    //add more events here...
  });

  //react when something has happened
  when.somethingHasHappened(function(){
    console.log("deal with it!");
  });
  
  //publish that something has happened
  proclaim.somethingHasHappened();

});
```

We create two variables that point to the same object, and use one of them (`when`) to subscribe to events and the other (`proclaim`) to publish events. Events are given past-tense names, to indicate that the subscribers should react to the event, and that the publishers can't assume to know who or what will react to the event. 

The publisher can call the event with parameters, which the subscribers will be called with. To indicate what parameters the publisher should call it with and what parameters the subscriber can expect to get, we declare the event as a function with parameters, like so:


```js
require(['deco/proclaimWhen'], function(proclaimWhen){
  
  var totalSum = 0;
  
  var when = proclaim = proclaimWhen.extend({
    aProductHasBeenAddedToTheCart: function(productId, productName, price){}
  });

  function updateTheTotalSum(productId, productName, price){
    totalSum += price;
  }

  when.aProductHasBeenAddedToTheCart(updateTheTotalSum);
  
  //somewhere completely different  
  proclaim.aProductHasBeenAddedToTheCart(9876, "Some cool product", 50);
  
  //much later  
  when.aProductHasBeenAddedToTheCart.dont(updateTheTotalSum);
  
  //nothing will happen now
  proclaim.aProductHasBeenAddedToTheCart(9876, "Some cool product", 50);

});
```

You can see in the last example how to declare that you are no longer interested in the `aProductHasBeenAddedToTheCart` event by using the `dont` function. After this point the `updateTheTotalSum` won't be called when the event is triggered. It is important to remember to unsubscribe from events when you are no longer interested in them!
