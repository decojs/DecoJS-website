<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Page change event</h1>
</div>

When creating a SPA you often need to know which url the user is currently visiting. Often you also need to split this url into different segments and get to one of those segments. In DecoJS viewmodels can be notified whenever the url updates and a new view has been loaded and put into the `data-outlet` by subscribing to the `thePageHasChanged` event, which is available from the `deco/events` module. DecoJS will proclaim that `thePageHasChanged` and will pass along the current view path, as a string, the segments, as an array of strings, and the `document.location` object.

Viewmodels inside the `data-outlet` can listen to this event, and when they receive it (which will be just after they have finished initializing) they can look at the segments and pick out parts of the url they are interested in, for example the id from a url like `/user/1234`. 

Viewmodels outside the `data-outlet` can also listen to the event, and they can update their state depending on it, for example like the main menu above does. It can be implemented like this:

#### index.html
```html
<ul data-viewmodel="NavVM">
  <li data-bind="css: {selected: page()=='About'}"><a href="#/About">About</a></li>
  <li data-bind="css: {selected: page()=='Contact'}"><a href="#/Contact">Contact</a></li>
  <li data-bind="css: {selected: page()=='Guestbook'}"><a href="#/Guestbook">Guestbook</a></li>
</ul>
```

#### NavVM.js
```js
define(['knockout', 'deco/events'], function(ko, events){
  function(model, when){    
    this.page = ko.observable();
    
    when(events.thePageHasChanged, function(path, segments){
      this.page(segments[0]);
    });
  };
});
```
