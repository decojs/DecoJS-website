  <h1>When a viewmodel is destroyed</h1>
</div>

[Yesterday](#04) we saw how to use pubsub to communicate between viewmodels, and how DecoJS will automatically unsubscribe from events when a viewmodel is ready for garbage collection. It is very important to clean up after viewmodels when they are destroyed, and event subscriptions are only one of the things we need to clean up. To help with the clean up we can use `when.thisIsDestroyed`.

```js
require('ClockVM', [], function(){
  
  return function ClockVM(model, when){
    var self = this;
  
    this.currentTime = ko.observable();
    
    init: {
      var intval = setInterval(function(){
        self.currentTime(new Date().toISOString());
      }, 100);
      
      when.thisIsDestroyed(function(){
        clearInterval(intval);
      });
    }
  }
});
```

`when.thisIsDestroyed` takes a function that will be called when the viewmodel is unbound from the DOM and ready for garbage collection. By clearing the interval in the viewmodel above we make sure that the browser doesn't keep any reference to the viewmodel.
