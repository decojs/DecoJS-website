  <h1>Caching views</h1>
</div>

When DecoJS loads a view from the server it will by default cache it in memory, the same way RequireJS caches AMD modules, so that it doesn't need to fetch the view from the server every time the view is needed. This works great if the view is a static html file, but is not so great if the server is an MVC application. 

DecoJS lets you provide a [model](#/reference/model) to your viewmodel using the `data-model` attribute, which is a great way to send data along with the view from an MVC application. Unfortunately this isn't of much use if the view is cached, since every visit to the view will have the same data. That is why there is an option in the config to turn caching off:

```js
require(['deco'], function(deco){
  deco.config({
    spa: {
      cachePages: false
    }
  }).start();
});
```

When `cachePages` is false it will load the view from the server every time it is requested, and to make sure it isn't being cached on the way to the client it will append a cache busting query parameter, [just like we did with the viewmodels](#02).
